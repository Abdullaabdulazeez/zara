Hello, everyone! My name is Zara, and I'm an adventurous 5-year-old. I used to live in the 
beautiful state of Kerala, where palm trees swayed and colorful flowers bloomed. 
But guess what? Now I'm all the way in Kuwait! It's a whole new world filled with tall buildings, 
bustling streets, and amazing sights to explore.

Even though I'm far from my homeland, my heart is always with my family. 
I have the most incredible parents, Razana and Shazul, and the sweetest young brother named Hyzin Shazul. 
They fill my days with love, laughter, and lots of fun adventures.We share wonderful moments together, 
whether it's playing games, going on nature walks, or just cuddling up for a bedtime story.

In addition to all the excitement in my life, I'm also focused on my education. Currently 
I am studying in LKG (Lower Kindergarten). Every day, I get to learn new things, make friends and 
explore the wonders of knowledge. My teachers are amazing, and they make learning so much fun!

When I'm not busy exploring, spending time with my family, or studying, I have some exciting hobbies. 
 I absolutely love watching cartoons on YouTube; they make me laugh and take me on amazing adventures without 
leaving my room.Besides that, I have a passion for dancing and swimming. Whenever I hear music, my feet start tapping
and I can't resist moving to the rhythm. And when it's time to cool off and have fun in the water, you can always 
find me swimming and splashing around.
